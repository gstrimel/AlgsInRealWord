\section{I/O Model}
The standard theoretical model for analyzing algorithms is known as the the \textit{Ram Model}.
The model assumes an infinitely sized memory with a uniform cost for each access.  An algorithm's efficiency is then 
evaluated in this model by the number of operations between variables and pieces of memory performed during execution. 
Though theoreticall valid when ..., the model is not sufficient to capture hierarchical nature and locality sensitives of the memory 
system in a real computer system.

A real modern computer often has many ``cacheing" layers for memory access.  Layers which are closer to the CPU, 
like the L1 and L2 caches, are small in size and cost less for accesses. Caches which further down in the hierarchy, such as 
main memory and hard drive, are much larger but are expensive to access.
