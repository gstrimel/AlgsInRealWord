==============

We have implemented main functions that test each class, as well as main functions to to compare the number of cache misses over different parameters.

The tar file includes pre-compiled binaries for our tests. Should these not work, we have also included an ANT buildfile "build.xml" which can be used to build the project.

All commands should be run from the root directory of the tar file.

$ java -classpath bin IOEfficientMergeSortTest

$ java -classpath bin ListRankingTest

$ java -classpath bin com.airw.sorts.SortComparison

$ java -classpath bin com.airw.sorts.SortBlockSizeComparison
